Let's use California as an example, which, in 2016, had 53 representatives and 2 senators.\n\n Thus, California has 55 electoral votes. ",
        "If a candidate wins the majority vote in a state, the candidate takes all of that state's Electoral Votes. In California, the majority voted for Hillary Clinton (61.7%). Because of this, Clinton took all 55 of California's electoral votes.",
        "To win the Presidential Election, a candidate must receive the most electoral votes, which currently totals to 270 out of 538.",
        "Just because a candidate wins the popular vote, does not mean they will win the electoral vote. In 2016, more people in the U.S. voted for Clinton than Trump. However, Trump had more Electoral Votes, giving him the Presidency.",

In many countries the party with the most members in the legislature has great control over the government",
        "The number of political parties differs from country to country. Some countries have several parties, and all of them may be represented in the government. Many European countries have three or more major political parties",
        "Other countries function with only two major parties. In the United States the two main political parties are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Other parties, called third parties, may exist in such a system. However, most people support either of the two main parties. It is almost impossible for third parties to gain power.",
        "Still other countries have one-party systems. China, Cuba, and several African countries have such systems. There all members of the government must belong to the same party. People might form opposing parties, but their candidates may not run for office. Opposing parties may even be illegal. Such groups are sometimes called underground political parties.",
